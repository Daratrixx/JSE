# [JSE] - The PC Journey Save Editor for Windows
This is a GUI save editor for the PC version of Journey.

## Releases
[No releases are available yet]

## Resources
This project uses Qt 5.12.3, although no specific features from this version are used, so it can be changed if necessary.

## How to use
Start the application. You will be asked to locate the SAVE.BIN file. It is most likely stored in your Documents folder, under the Journey directory (*i.e. C:/Users/[your username]/Documents/Journey/SAVE.BIN*)
Once located, the file will be read and displayed by the application. You can then modify any properties.

## TO-DOs
 * Improve look and usability
 * Add proper packaging to CMAKE
 * Release first version!
 * Make a working symbol selector (with pictures)

## Thanks
I'd like to thank the wonderful people from the Journey moding community, their knowledge helped kick this project up and running.
